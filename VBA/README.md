# Assignment Background: The VBA of Wall Street

This assignment focuses on using VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 
### Files
This assignment focused on using two data sources. [Test Data](Resources/alphabtical_testing.xlsx) was used to develop VBS scripts that were then translated to work within the included [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) file for final reports.

### Techniques Used:
* Create a script that will loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock had over that year and the ticker symbol to coincide with the total stock volume.

* Impliment the previous code into the larger sheet and apply the following:

  * Calculate yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * Calculate the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  
  * Include conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
